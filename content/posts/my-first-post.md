In a land arid and sparse, 
A sculptor  with nothing to craft
All with his tools,  he is alone
Away from his atelier, 
In the quest for a stone. 

Wanderlust has taken away by the wind
Thirst persists though he is stubborn to rewind.
Wrapped in the sand,  storm blinded his way
Nothing could stop him,  he moved on, 
In the quest to win his bay

Eyes traveled far, aspiring to delight
Seems his travel ceases on that sight.
That painted  in blue that gives life, 
Shaded in green that reflects lives
White limestone there in between in heights.
Closer he reached, farther it goes 
Gained with a sprint,  but goes in vain,  
It vanished and made him insane.
With a sigh again he commence,
In the quest for a stone

Farther he goes, he felt the vultures
Death looms, to feed and rupture, 
His desires  taciturn, but strong
Fought a war to survive, 
The quest goes along.

Halfway to realize his dreams 
On the foot of a dune atlast he arrived
In the oasis of hope,  where  he revived.
The little breeze preen him from his feet, 
As a groom,  he goes on, 
The quest for his better half

He could see stones many 
Well garnished and shiny,  
But none with soul and all hollow.
Walked on in solo, 
The  quest for his soul mate

Discarded in the dirt, the last stone lies
Covered  with mosses and fern away from light 
Unseen he stumbled and rammed on that stone
In that pain, he  felt her soul, 
The quest is done!

Cleansed her with his  blood 
Venerated  with the tears he shed
Caressed her ; the child of the earth
Untied his desires, slowly and lovely 
To carve this beauty, lost lady-love

The lady he loved, still a stone,  carved out.
Still he bleeds, no more life to see her alive
Heard her voice, whispers of leaves? 
He opened his eyes, there she is !
Lady love, took his head on her lap
They kissed till the last gasp, 
Merging their soul ,they turned to stone,
The lament ends,  dissolving  to the earth
